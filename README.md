# Adaptive-Hybrid-Artificial-Bee-Colony-Algorithm

To deal with the slow convergence of The heuristic optimization method of artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, it is proposed an adaptive hybrid ABC (AHABC) algorithm that dynamically combines Nelder-Mead simplex search method with ABC. AHABC produces faster and more accurate convergence when compared to ABC and similar approaches. The AHABC is applied for the Maximum Likelihood estimation of the q-Weibull distribution parameters. The q-Weibull model is based on the Tsallis non-extensive entropy and is able to model various behaviors of the hazard rate function, including bathtub curves, by using a single set of parameters. Despite its flexibility, the q-Weibull has not been widely used in reliability applications partly because of the complicated parameters estimation. The estimation procedure is applied to real reliability failure data characterized by a bathtub-shaped hazard rate.
